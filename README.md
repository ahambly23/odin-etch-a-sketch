# odin-etch-a-sketch

In this project, I’ll be creating a pretty neat toy to flex my DOM manipulation skills. I'm going to build a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

Create two buttons - Black & Rainbow

An event listener for each button, changing the colour from black to rainbow or vice versa.
